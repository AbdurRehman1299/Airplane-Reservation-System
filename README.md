**Airline Management System Using Data Structures and Algorithms**

This project is a fully functional Airline Management System built using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It demonstrates efficient booking, cancellation, and passenger management processes by implementing linked lists, and file handling. Designed to handle seat allocations, flight schedules, and customer data, this system optimizes for speed and accuracy in real-time operations.

Key features:

•Reservation Management: Quickly book, cancel, and view reservations.

•Passenger and Flight Management: Keep track of passenger details, flight statuses, and seat assignments.

•Data Structures in Action: Singly Linked lists, and more for optimal performance.

This repository serves as a practical example for learning and implementing DSA concepts in a real-world scenario, perfect for developers and students interested in data structures, algorithms, and system design.
