Airplane Reservation System Using Data Structures and Algorithms

This project is a fully functional Airplane Reservation System built using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It demonstrates efficient booking, cancellation, and passenger management processes by implementing queues, linked lists, trees, and hash maps. Designed to handle seat allocations, flight schedules, and customer data, this system optimizes for speed and accuracy in real-time operations.

Key features:

Reservation Management: Quickly book, cancel, and view reservations.
Passenger and Flight Management: Keep track of passenger details, flight statuses, and seat assignments.
Data Structures in Action: Uses queues, linked lists, and more for optimal performance.
This repository serves as a practical example for learning and implementing DSA concepts in a real-world scenario, perfect for developers and students interested in data structures, algorithms, and system design.
